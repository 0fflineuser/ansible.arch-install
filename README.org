* How to use

** Unplug all the target drives which will not be used for the lvm setup

** Boot the targets with the archlinux install iso from a usb stick
[[https://archlinux.org/download/]]

** Remove the usb stick

** Connect the targets to wifi if needed
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd]]

** Once booted in the install media set the root password using the `passwd` command.

** Install ansible and the community.general collections in the ansible control computer
#+begin_src bash
sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring ansible
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
#+end_src

** Update variables and metadata
- Add the hosts ips under [installtargets] group in the inventory file

- Update the `vars` in the playbook.yml

- Update the hostname in the `host_vars` files (e.g. installtargets.yml)

- Generate the {{ user_password }} for group_vars or each host_vars with

  #+begin_src bash
  echo "MyPassword" | openssl passwd -1 -stdin
  #+end_src

** Copy the ssh key of the control pane to the inventory hosts
#+begin_src bash
eval $(ssh-agent)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-copy-id <ansible_user>@<ip>
#+end_src

** Check that all the hosts are working
#+begin_src bash
ansible installtargets -i inventory -m command -a date
#+end_src

** Run the playbook
#+begin_src bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml
#+end_src
